- Arrays cannot be initialized without specifying content type
```
//: Will produce an error because the compiler doesn’t know what’s going to be in the array
var otherArray: Array

//: Need to tell the compiler the array contents wrapped in <>
var otherArray: Array<String>

//: You must also add element to the array before appending additional items

//Bad
otherArray.append("broken")

// Good
otherArray = []
otherArray.append("stuff")
```

- vars are mutable
- lets are immutable
- Optionals allows you to set a variable to something or nothing
- Non-optionals can never be set to nil after
